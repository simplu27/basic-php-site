# Basic PHP Site

A basic PHP site built by myself, following the [course on Team TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-basic-php-website).

The site is live on this [AWS server](52.37.51.157). It uses GitHub auto deploy, following the instructions [here](http://www.thisprogrammingthing.com/2013/automatically-updating-your-website-using-githubs-service-hooks/).
