# Basic PHP Site

A basic PHP site built by myself, following the [course on Team TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-basic-php-website), to showcase a website with basic PHP functions.

The site is live on this [AWS server](http://52.37.51.157).

## Features
- Code factoring with separate header and footer files for all pages with [`<?php include(); ?>`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.include.php)
- [`_$GET`](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.get.php) in URLs such as `href="catalog.php?cat=books"`
- Multidimentional associative array
